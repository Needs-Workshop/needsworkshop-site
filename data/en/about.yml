I'm Dan Young, founder of Needs Workshop. 


I've spent much of my career in technology, product development and consulting. In 2016 I co-founded a  
consultancy called EngineerBetter, to help orgasniations be more effective at delivering value through software.


Then I [fired myself from EngineerBetter](https://www.engineerbetter.com/blog/farewell-to-engineerbetter). Why?


Well, over recent years I had the opportunity to experience software product teams that worked beautifully. I’ve seen clear, expressive stories, 
folks pair or mob programming and having fun, conversation bubbling away. I’ve seen continuous delivery in action, test-driven development, 
quality built straight in, and seemingly very little waste or rework. These moments were majestic. When these teams had “flow” they cut their way 
through a feature backlog like a woodchipper, adjusted quickly to change, and built robust, maintainable things. 


But even when things looked great **in the team**, things were most definitely not great elsewhere.


Whenever I zoomed out to look at the bigger picture in the organisation, I saw a complex landscape of tension and dysfunction. 


Agile on its own offered no opinion on how to organise the upstream flow of value from ideas to engineering (the fuzzy front end), 
or how to organise software development at program level. And the corporate agile frameworks, or digital transformation theatre
that moved in to occupy this vacuum seemed to be creating more problems than they solved.


Most crucially, Agile provided zero insight on **what business value actually is**.


And if nobody knew what was valuable, how did anyone know if we were doing the right thing in the first place? 
What use was quality engineering, rapid iteration and learning on something which didn’t make a difference? **What 
was the point, if we weren’t meeting anyone’s needs?**


We'd always aspired to tackling organisation-level challenges at EngineerBetter, but in the business system that emerged I wasn't finding the
right kind of space or business relationships to explore this, not least because I was living in the wrong city.


In my ongoing quest to move collaborative knowledge work into a better place, I came to recognise the importance of reflecting on needs in order to
understand collective behaviour. Customer needs, of course,  but also the needs of everyone inside the organisation. When folks’ needs were being met I saw 
flow in the wider organisation. When they remained unmet I saw tension.  


Recognising that work in the space between people was where the magic happened, I began to develop a new style of practice that combined group facilitation 
with a humble consulting approach. Through this I aimed to do **less telling and more listening and asking**, identifying the needs 
within and outside organisations, and connecting folks with more effective strategies for meeting these needs. 


Needs Workshop is the project I created to focus on this work. To find out more, I'd invite you to read about some **[examples](/examples)**.
